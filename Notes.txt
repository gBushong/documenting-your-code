Notes:

Steps for documentation:

In the Code
-----------
 1. Comment your code
    - Tricky bits
    - explain reasoning
    - poorly named library functions etc

 2. Type annotations in functions

 3. Docstrings
   - Pep 257:
      * always include at least a one-line docstring
      * Use triple-double quotes, not single
      * Try not to repeat the function/class name

   - you can add examples to docstrings that will auto-run
      like a test!
   - auto docstrings should work in sublime
